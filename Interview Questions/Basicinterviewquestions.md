### What is the most challenging task you have done so far

### Can you explain branching strategy followed by your organization
A branching strategy helps define how the delivery team functions and how each feature, improvement, or bug fix is handled. It also reduces the complexity of the delivery pipeline by allowing developers to focus on developments and deployments only on the relevant branchesâ€”without affecting the entire product.

* Support collaboration by enabling parallel development so that multiple developers can work on different project tasks simultaneously.
* Support version control by complying with prevailing repository and version control systems.
* Support the existing workflow from production or release.

### When build fails what do you do

### What is a pull request?
  * pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a        feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their Bitbucket account.
